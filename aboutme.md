title: About me
subtitle: Why you want to fund my research
---

I am a Phd student doing interdisciplinary research at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, in the Integrated Intelligence Lab. I am fascinated by work on the interface of Physics and Artificial Intelligence, and want to make advancements in both fields. On the Physics side, I use Artificial Intelligence to make advances in Nanophotonics. In particular, I aim to improve the computational methods for inverse design of nanophotonic components using neural networks.

On the AI side, I want to use the tools of Physics to better understand how neural networks learn. Currently these neural networks are regarded as a black box, with the tools of Physics we can make them more transparent to make them more reliable and increase their performance. 

### My history

I started my Master in Physics at the VUB because I wanted to understand how the world around us works. It still amazes me how most everyday phenomena can be explained by a set of simple laws and equations. During my Masters, I did an Erasmus to EPFL, Switzerland. It was during this time that I got more and more interested in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in particular. When I came back to Belgium, I did a project in Deep Learning in the MRI department of the UZ Jette. I was also very happy to perform a master thesis at the VUB, where I was able to apply Deep Learning to design components in Nanophotonics.
