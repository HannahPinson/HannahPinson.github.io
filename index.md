# Research

I am a Phd student on an FWO asipirant scholarschip in the Integrated Intelligence Lab at VUB in Belgium. This lab is headed by prof. Vincent Ginis and studies intelligence from multiple facets. These include artificial intelligence, biological intelligence and intelligent systems for the social sciences. My research spans the intersection between artificial intelligence and Physics.

I am particularly interested in the inverse design of nanophotonic components using neural networks. Photonics underlies most of the technology we see around us, such as computers, smartphones and the internet. Improving the computational methods designing these components using AI dramatically increases their speed and flexibility. 

# Teaching

I am teaching the course "Advanced Mathematics for Business Economics" to third year undergraduate students. This course introduces advanced mathematical concepts such as infinite sequences and series, systems of differential equations and nonlinear dynamics. It also gives an introduction to programming in the Wolfram language of Mathematica.
